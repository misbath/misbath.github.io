# My Bio

My name is Misbath and I am a current Climate and Health PhD candidate in Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health. My work focuses on the distribution of benefits from energy transitions in the context of climate change both in the US and in the Global South. Using methodologies from environmental epidemiology, exposure assessment, and machine learning, I aim to generate evidence that can support the centering of equity in energy transition policy and initiatives. Before joining Mailman, I received an MPH in Environmental Health from the Harvard School of Public Health. During my time at Harvard, I worked on energy, air pollution, and children's health projects in Alaska, Tunisia, and Mongolia.
